# multi-tier-server-infrastructure
I have successfully completed a project involving the deployment of a two-tier, multi-AZ server
infrastructure. The infrastructure was designed to meet the following requirements:

•Two private servers in two different availability zones (AZ).
•Two public servers in two different AZ's.
•Two servers in two different subnets, namely private and public.
•The main and custom route tables were equipped with an internet gateway and NAT gateway.

Upon completion of the deployment, it was possible to connect to the private Linux server via the jump
or bastion server located in the public subnet. The entire infrastructure was carefully configured and
deployed to ensure maximum reliability and security.
